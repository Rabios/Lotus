- Download documentations from [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=172GwQz75SoVWHgGxI8F00T-jj6tpioiR)
- Extract documentations archive in the directory you extracted the repository,Once a folder named `docs` appears,Go next step
- Download packages archive [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1dIUchwWa85p49pTk_IvsgbU1sXJ8RgAI)
