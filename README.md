## How to run from source
- Download and install both 64-bit versions of Python 3 and 7zip
- Download this repository as ZIP
- Extract it anywhere
- Create folder named `projects` in the directory you extracted the repository,Leave it empty
- Download documentations from [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=172GwQz75SoVWHgGxI8F00T-jj6tpioiR)
- Extract documentations archive in the directory you extracted the repository,Once a folder named `docs` appears,Go next step
- Download packages archive [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1dIUchwWa85p49pTk_IvsgbU1sXJ8RgAI)
- When packages archive downloaded,Create folder named `inbound` inside `resources` folder (Inside repository extracted folder),And move downloaded packages archive to it
- Create folder named `cache` inside `resources` folder,But keep it empty
- Get back to the repository folder,Run `install_dependencies.bat` if you installed Python 3 and 7zip
- Run `launch.bat`,And check that you have installed Python 3 and 7zip
- As the first startup for Lotus IDE,It will extract packages archive so first startup may take minutes
- That's all,I know i know these are very long steps but i promise that they are working %100
